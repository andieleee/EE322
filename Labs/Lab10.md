# Lab 10: Blockchain

First I ran the hash_value code and noticed that the fields for the hash value of Python, vowels, and objects changed between each execution. The hash value is different every time because the hash function is incredibly sensitive to input changes and also allows the same inputs to have different hashes, preventing hash collision and strengthening hash security.
